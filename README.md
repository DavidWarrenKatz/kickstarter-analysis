# kickstarter-analysis

## Overview of Project
	In this project, we analyzed a set of data on Kickstarter campaigns to try and answer specific questions about what correlated to the success of a project. 

### Purpose
	The purpose of this project was to analyze a large set of data on various crowdfunded projects, and determine what insights could be gleaned from this data to answer specific questions about plays. 

## Analysis and Challenges
	The primary challenge was to decide how to organize the data to discover factors correlated to the success of the project. It is not immediately clear if launch date, funding period, country of origin, etc. should correlate with success. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
	The most successful month to start a project was May and the least successful was September and October. 


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
	Having smaller goals was correlated with more successful projects and having larger goals was correlated with less successful projects. 


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
	The charts we created suggest some correlations between goals and start date to the success of the project, but I am not sure how to tell if these correlations are significant. 


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
	There does seem to be a correlation between the launch date and success of the project, with a launch date around May being correlated to higher success and a launch date around September correlated to lower successes and more failures. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	There does seem to be a correlation between goals and outcomes. Having smaller goals was correlated with more successful projects and having larger goals was correlated with less successful projects. This is expected since it is easier to attain smaller goals. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
	The dataset may not be large enough to conclude that these correlations are significant. There may have also been other factors not included in the data that were important to determining the success of a project. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
	It would be helpful to create of graph comparing the funding period to success rate. Perhaps the successful project were primarily successful because they had a longer window to accumulate backers.
